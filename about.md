I started young by creating some websites to talk about my passion, and finally got interested in many notions of CS.
So, I started by doing some web development; to finally start developing in JAVA.

Nowadays, I'm mostly developing for the Android platform, and starting as an Auto-Entrepreneur, while still studying Computer Science, trying to get an Engineering Degree in France.
