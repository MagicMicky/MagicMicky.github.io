So, this is my first blog post.

First let me introduce myself.
My name is Mickael, I'm a student in an Engineering school in Toulouse, France (INSA). I've been found of CS since I was young enough to hold a mouse, and now, I consider myself as a self-taught android developper.

Around here, I'll be talking a lot about Android Development. Since I've been working on Android for a few years, I've started to find some interesting stuff that I could share with you.


Feel free to follow me on twitter, and comment and share and everything ! :-)


Cheers! :)
